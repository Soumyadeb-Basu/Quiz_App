# Quiz_App

Created a Quiz Application that makes use of two core services - 
  1. Question
  2. Quiz

The Question service allows us to create Quiz questions along with options, right answer and question category. We can also view the questions created and add new questions.

The Quiz service creates quiz with certain number of questions and on a particular category, selecting random questions that are already present in Question table in database. We can also get the Quiz questions for the user, and after the user has submitted all the questions for a certain quiz, the total Number of correct questions answered are displayed.
